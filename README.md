# Advanced XAI Project: Credit Score Modeling

## Description

Addis Ababa University Business Enterprise (AAUBE) plays a crucial role in understanding and improving financial decision-making in the Ethiopian market economy. Access to credit is essential for individuals and companies to thrive, and credit scoring models are a key tool for determining the likelihood of default. These models help financial institutions decide whether to grant loans and under what terms. In this project, you will build a credit scoring model to predict the probability that a borrower will experience financial distress in the next two years. The goal is not only to develop an accurate predictive model but also to apply advanced Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to interpret and explain the model's decisions. This will help borrowers and stakeholders understand the factors influencing credit decisions and make informed financial choices.

AAUBE provides historical data from 250,000 borrowers to support your analysis.

## Project Objectives

1. **Model Development:** Build a machine learning model to predict the probability of financial distress.
2. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics, including AUC-ROC.
3. **Explainability:** Apply various XAI techniques to interpret the model's predictions and provide actionable insights (LIME, SHAPE, FI).
4. **Reporting:** Document your process, findings, and recommendations in a comprehensive report.

## Dataset

You will work with a dataset containing historical data of 250,000 borrowers. The dataset includes features such as:

* Demographic information (e.g., age, income, employment status)
* Financial history (e.g., credit utilization, payment history, outstanding debt)
* Loan-related information (e.g., loan amount, loan purpose)
* Target variable: Financial distress (binary classification: 1 = distress, 0 = no distress)
* Dataset

## Deliverables

To successfully complete this project, you are expected to submit the following deliverables:

1. **Data Preprocessing Report:**
    * Describe the steps taken to clean and preprocess the data (e.g., handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling).
    * Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, correlations, and potential biases in the dataset.

2. **Model Development:**
    * Train and evaluate at least three different machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting).
    * Optimize hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search.
    * Compare the performance of the models using evaluation metrics such as AUC-ROC, precision, recall, and F1-score.

3. **Explainability Analysis:**
    * Apply at least three XAI techniques to interpret your best-performing model. Examples include:
        * **Feature Importance:** Use techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to identify the most important features.
        * **Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs):** Visualize the relationship between specific features and the predicted outcome.
        * **Counterfactual Explanations:** Generate examples of how changes in input features could alter the model's predictions.
    * Discuss the insights gained from these techniques and their implications for borrowers and lenders.

4. **Ethical Considerations:**
    * Analyze potential biases in the dataset and model predictions.
    * Propose strategies to mitigate these biases and ensure fairness in credit scoring.

5. **Final Report:**
    * Provide a detailed report summarizing your methodology, results, and insights.
    * Include visualizations (e.g., ROC curves, SHAP summary plots) to support your findings.
    * Conclude with recommendations for improving the credit scoring process and enhancing transparency using XAI techniques.
